## **Missing Person Detection**

Disappearance is a worldwide problem. Over the last few decades the World has been shocked by accounts of tens of thousands of people who are known to have disappeared due to one or another reason. Forced disappearances have an effect on the individual, his/her family and the community as a whole. The problems that family members of disappeared persons face are complex and can be overwhelming. Besides the uncertainty about the fate of their relatives, they usually have to cope with economic, social, legal and mental problems as well. The current system is overwhelmed with many complaints as it mostly depends on manual work and is limited to law enforcement agencies. 

We have come up with a system where we use advanced tech like Face recognition with the help of deep metric learning algorithms and developed a website where it is easier to upload and maintain the database of all the missing people. We also took the advantage of the mobile culture developing around and have enabled anyone to upload a video which might help us find the missing person easily. This also reduces the search time and decreases the work load on police as our model continously goes through both the CCTV footage and also those uploaded by the community and notifies the concerned authorities their current whearabouts.
